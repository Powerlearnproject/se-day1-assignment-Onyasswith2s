Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is the systematically applies engineering principles, methods and tools to develop and maintain high quality software 
importance are enabling the creation of software applications, developing operating system 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
the birth of software engineerng
the rise of structured programming 
the advent of agile methodolgies 


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
initiation- coming up with the idea of what software to make 
planning- step by step instructions that is made for the making of the software 
implemantation- after the planning is done, the software is then started to be made 
closure- making sure that the software made is able to work properly as it ws intended to do so 

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer work is to design, program, build, deploy and maintan a software 
Quality Assuaranve Engineer work is test, debug and compliance the software to make sure it's ready for the public use 
Project Manfer work is to plan , make sure there is proper team coordination, monitor the team and be able yo understand the risk managment when making of a software 

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDE's help fprogrammers develop software codes efficeinetly E.g xcode, eclipse, komodo 
VCS help manage the source code of the software team to keep track of all code modification E.g Bitkeeoer, version control, Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
lack of visiblity- invest in some tools that empower your team to make data driven decisions
broken SDLC proccesse= making sure the team is well trained 
struggling people well being- reducing distraction and making the team focus on the task 
 
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt  Engineering is simply coming up with a queation expecing answers that will help you do the task that you asked for 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
